# Python-Project-1
for this project I was asked to write a functioning, novel program showcasing

1. User Input
2. String manipulation
3. Use of a dictionary
4. List comprehension
5. Clean function definitions using at least 3 functions to separate code

This program uses a dictionary of local food places organized by catagory.
Uses input to get name and selection of where to eat.
Uses list comprehension to create lists of values for each key.
Seperates each part of my program into three working functions.
